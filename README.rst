Mobile Map Downloader is a command line program to download maps from the 
Internet and install them on mobile devices, such as smart phones. The program 
is intended to run on a (personal) computer, that has a fast and cheap Internet connection, and a large hard disk. The downloaded maps are also stored on the local computer.

The software is currently in **alpha state** and can therefore not be used.
